# CatBook

A React Redux application that consumes data from the CatBook Rails 5 API. Users can log in, create, edit, delete and view cats and their associated hobbies (yes, cats have hobbies). 

You can play around with the deployed app [here](https://catbook-react.herokuapp.com/). Log in with sample user:

* username: sophie
* password: password

Uses:
* React
* Redux
* React Router
* Redux Thunk middleware
* Custom JWT authentication system integrates with JWT auth on the Rails API side.

## Why Did I Build This?

This app was built out to accompany my series of eight blog posts on building a simpel React Redux application. 
You can check out those posts [here](http://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/building-a-simple-crud-app-with-react-redux-part-1/#table-of-contents), view my post on JWT auth with React [here](http://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/jwt-authentication-with-react-redux/), and my post on deploying React Redux to Heroku [here](http://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/deploying-react-redux-to-heroku/).
